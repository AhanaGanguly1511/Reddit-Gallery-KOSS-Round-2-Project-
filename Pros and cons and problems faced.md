**PROS AND CONS OF THE TOOLS I USED**

For building up the code,I used html language along with JavaScript(the
jQuery functions to be precise).

**HTML**

**Pros**-

1.Well interpreted by almost all the browsers.

2.Supports a lot of languages(we mostly used JavaScipt with html).It's
also widely used and hugely popular so the code can be easily
interpreted by many of the people willing to learn these things.

**Cons**

1.Requires a browser to interpret it correctly otherwise we many not
find out out logical errors which we made in the code.

2.Usually people need to write a lot of code to make even the simplest
websites.

**jQUERY LIBRARY OF JAVASCRIPT**

**Pros**

The main pro of jQuery is that it contains a lot of in-built functions
which can make a large task seemingly difficult , very easy .We can
accomplish any particular task by writing a few lines of code by using
the functions of jQuery.We used some of them in our code.This library
also interacts well with other types of codes so is very flexible.

**Cons**

jQuery library functions may seem to be very complex for those who don't
know how to handle it properly and may lead to the person writing lines
and lines of code without getting any solution to the problem.

**PROBLEMS I FACED DURING THE PROJECT**

1.Reading the .json file with little knowledge about it seemed to be a
herculean task to me,But then I learnt deeply about how to read a .json
file,what does it contain and how does it store information by taking
help from te internet and videos.Finally I was successful in reading it
and thus writing the code.

2.While wirting the code, I was not getting the perfect outcome which I
wanted (the images were not getting displayed and it showed some icons
in place of it).It was a logical error on my part as I had writted
resolutions in place of source in line 21 as I misinterpreted the .json
file.Finally with much effort, I could resolve the issue.

3.Though I could extract the images from the urls given in the .json file, I could not align the images properly one by one.
