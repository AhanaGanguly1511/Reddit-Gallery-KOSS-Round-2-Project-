**The main project**

**THE QUESTION**

Ayush likes to view images on reddit but doesn't like the UI much. He
likes images from r/pics subreddit. He wants to build a frontend only
app to view images from the subreddit. Make it for him.

**THE INITIAL APPROACH**

Initially, I had no idea about what a .json file was and how to read out
elements form it.I read the question multiple times and also gathered
information from the internet about what exactly is a .json file, what
information does it store and so on.

After that,I knew about .json file that its a type of file **which
stores simple data structure and objects in JavaScript Object Notation
format**.

**WHAT DID I DO AFTER I UNDERSTOOD WHAT EXACTLY A .JSON FILE IS**

Basically,I was provided with the **url** of a .json file containing
several details of different objects and urls of a lot of images in them
which I had to extract and show it by building a *front-end* website.

After understanding what a .json file was,I tried to read it so that I
could try to get a clue on how to extract it.I didn't ever try
extracting a .json file before so I didn't know what to do.I searched up
different codes from the internet using different methods to accomplish
this task but couldn't do much progress in it.

Finally , after searching up different things and learning about how to
extract a .json file, I wrote up a code and debugged it to extract the
file.

**WHAT CODING LANGUAGE I USED FOR EXTRACTING THE INFORMATION OUT OF THE
.JSON FILE**

I used HTML language(made up an html file) and used the jQuery library
functions of JavaScript over there to extract the .json file.
